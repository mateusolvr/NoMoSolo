# NoMoSolo
Mobile App Development group project

NoMoSolo is a social media application that helps bring musicians together. The appâ€™s algorithm enables musicians to find other musicians to jam or gig with, using their specified preferences of an ideal musical partner(s), enabling them to match, talk to each other and create notes.
